I'm gonna be a First-year Ph.D. student at WM, VA. previously, I acquired my B.S. in UESTC (2020) and M.S. in NUS (2022).
At UESTC I worked with [Dr. Zeheng Wang](https://people.csiro.au/W/Z/zeheng-wang) who introduced me to the world of research and sparked my curiosity in pushing the frontiers of science. At NUS, I completed my Master's research projects under the supervision of [Dr. John Ho](https://www.ece.nus.edu.sg/stfpage/hsyj/people.html) and Dr. Xi Tian. Then I started my AI research experience as a remote intern under the supervision of Dr. Xuejiao Zhao, I appreciate for this research opportunity to expand my potential to engage in the AI field. Please feel free to reach out for any discussions about academics, sports, photography, and cooking!
