I'm gonna be a First-year Ph.D. student from fall 2024 at William & Mary, VA. Previously, I acquired my B.Eng. in UESTC (2020) and M.S. in NUS (2022).
At UESTC I worked with [Dr. Zeheng Wang](https://people.csiro.au/W/Z/zeheng-wang) who introduced me to the world of research and sparked my curiosity in pushing the frontiers of science. At NUS, I completed my Master's research projects under the supervision of [Dr. John Ho](https://www.ece.nus.edu.sg/stfpage/hsyj/people.html) and [Dr. Xi Tian](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/tx1_en/main.htm). Then I started my AI research experience as a remote intern under the supervision of [Dr. Xuejiao Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gcXa1o8AAAAJ&hl=en), I appreciate this research opportunity to expand my potential to engage in the AI field. My research interests lie in LLMs for knowledge representation, diffusion models for decision-making problems, and TBD. Outside of Academics I love sports such as basketball, climbing and Downhill mountain biking, photography, and cooking also are my hobbies!
